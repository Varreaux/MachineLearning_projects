 Coding out different ML model on various datasets

Project 1: Perceptron and Adaline (Adaptive Linear Neuron) are both types of artificial neural networks used in machine learning. The Perceptron is a simple binary classifier, while Adaline is an improvement that minimizes error based on continuous values, which helps with linear classification tasks.
